**There are two major decisions I need help from the community with:**

1. Nikko vs Takao + onsen (see Feb 26)
2. Shimanami Kaido vs Michelin restaurant tour (see Mar 1-3)

*A friend invited me to [Nikko](https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/tour_img-1323626-146.jpg) on my last trip but I couldn't go with her because of work. I really regret not being able to join her. After doing the research, Nikko seems pretty amazing.*

*It will be difficult to find random Redditors to come with me to Nikko, so this will likely be completely solo*

- Find a ryokan. **I'm open for recommendations.**
- I am thinking about booking a trip with a tour guide.
  - Toshogu Shrine
  - Taiyuin
  - [shinkyo bridge](http://loiclagarde.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Japan-nikko-web-momiji06.jpg)

- amazing ryokan [breakfast](https://i.imgur.com/Yg8hNPO.png) and then train back to tokyo next morning

**Mt. Takao**

- take the train from shinjuku, hike up the mountain a bit, have some specialty noodles
- onsen all that alcohol out of my body
- be back in Tokyo by nightfall

*I'm visiting a studio and a language translation company during the day*

##### Evening
- acquire random [Redditors](https://i.imgur.com/chCAdRU.png) for dinner at [Rokkasen](https://i.imgur.com/H53St1R.png). Getting the grilled meat fix in. All you can eat as well. [map](https://goo.gl/maps/bsKrmEBZSrUpodE88). Around 12500Y. I will probably organize a larger group to go to this one
- I'm interested in going to a strip club after reading about Japanese strip clubs and how they are weird. I think it would be unique and fun


#### Feb 28 Fri: Shimokitazawa + Kichijoji

##### Morning
- [purin](https://i.imgur.com/MIV4Ded.png) @ toyonchi no tamago
- start the day in shimokitazawa for some [vintage shopping](https://www.flip-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/1-33.jpg)

##### Evening
- There is this guy named Alejandro who runs bar hopping tours in Kichijoji. I think it will be hard to *acquire random redditors* to head all the way out to Kichijoji. Undecided if this is worth it

#### Feb 29 Sat: Ginza/Tokyo Station + Roppongi

##### Morning
- [fluffy japanese pancakes](https://i.imgur.com/54LD3vQ.png) @ happy pancake. These pancakes will be my last meal if I were on death row.

  - find [hidden treasures](https://i.imgur.com/KnqIPRc.png)
  - maybe try [fugu](https://i.imgur.com/ha9Xh50.png) again, but this time with an amazing view @ Usukifugu Yamadaya (Marunouchi Building, 35F)
  - The terrace on the 7th floor of the shin-marunouchi building also has a [nice view](https://i.imgur.com/FFSsF8A.png) without having to buy fugu

#### Mar 1-3: Shimanami Kaido [OR] Michelin Restaurant Tour in Tokyo

**Now there's a fork in the road. I haven't decided if I want to ride the [Shimanami Kaido](https://i.imgur.com/azUtqzI.png), or if I want to stay in Tokyo and try a bunch of Michelin rated restaurants**

1. If I go the Kansai region route, I'm in pretty good shape and I'm sure I could do the entire path in one day, but I might opt to take two days just for the leisure of it. I would take the Shinkansen down to Onomichi in the morning, bike halfway and find a place to stay about an hour before sundown. I'd spend the evening taking in some of the local atmosphere and chatting up anyone who is around. Next morning, finish the path, bus back to Onomichi and Shinkansen back to Tokyo to be back late March 2nd. **How silly is this? Should I save this for another trip? More imporantly, is this a good solo thing to do?**

2. If I go the Michelin restaurants route, the schedule becomes very relaxed as I'll still be in Tokyo.

- Michelin to check out: Torishiki (yakitori), Kotaro (izakaya), Iishibashi (unagi), Konda (tempura), Toritsune Shizendo (oyaokodon) and a few back-ups planned. It would be easy to *acquire [foodie Redditors](https://i.imgur.com/VN2IXm2.png)* to join.
- I'd also hit up Airbnb Experiences for a cooking class because I want to nail making tomago for those breakfast-in-beds of the future
- I'll catch a movie at a TOHO cinema
- There's a Nagomi visit which can put me in touch with hosts who want to share an activity together as well. That'd be unique.
